# Appwrite Database Migration Tool

_**Disclaimer:** This NPM package is in a very early stage, please wait for v1.0.0 release to use on your own projects, unless you want to provide feedback or contribute._

## Roadmap to v1.0.0

- [x] Run codegen implementation from a consuming project;
- [ ] Run the setup implementation against live Appwrite databases from a consuming project;
- [ ] Run the run migration sequence implementation against live Appwrite databases from a consuming project;
- [ ] Create one down sequence flow
- [ ] Run the one down sequence flow against live Appwrite databases from consuming proeject;
- [ ] Add integration tests with mocked Appwrite responses using MSW;

## Setting up

- Create a `GitHub Repository` to host your Appwrite functions.
  - You can use a repository you already own (e.g., `myproject-functions`).
- Create `environment` branches.
  - For example, the `main` branch can be assigned to `production` and `staging` branch can be
  assigned to `staging`. This allows you to have multiple Appwrite projects, using a single functions
  repository containing with multiple serverless entrypoints. Allowing you to effectively
  test a function in the staging project, before deploying the changes to the main (production)
  project.
- Set the repository as the Appwrite Serverless functions source.
  - [Appwrite Functions Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/functions/deployment).
  - [Appwrite Functions Video Series (~50m)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAPt7VBL_T8).
- Create a Appwrite Database per environment (project).
  - Not needed if you already have a Database.
- Create two Appwrite Functions, one called `Create Migrations Collection` and another called
`Run Migration Sequence`.
  - Do this once per project.
  - Point the functions at different branches of the repository
    - E.g.: point to main branch in production project, point to staging branch in the staging project.
  - Add the following contents to your functions respectively:

    ```ts
    import { createMigrationCollection } from '@franciscokloganb/appwrite-database-migration-tool'

    export default async (ctx) => {
      await createMigrationCollection({
        log: ctx.log,
        error: ctx.error,
      })
    }
    ```

    ```ts
    import { runMigrationSequence } from '@franciscokloganb/appwrite-database-migration-tool'

    export default async (ctx) => {
      await runMigrationSequence({
        log: ctx.log,
        error: ctx.error,
      })
    }
    ```

- Each function will require access to the following environment variables.
  - You can set **them globally in your Appwrite project settings** or scope them to each function.
  - **Ensure** the values match across functions, if you opted for the scoped approach.
  - **Ensure** the config does not change over time, if you ran the `runMigrationSequence` at least once.
    - Not that the config can be changed, but we do not recommended it, unless you planned a transition. Mistakes can leave your application in incosistent states.

  ```properties
  # Required
  APPWRITE_API_KEY=<your-appwrite-api-key>
  # Required
  APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=<your-appwrite-endpoint>
  # Required (when running locally instead of a serverless function environment)
  APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID=<your-appwrite-project-id>
  # Required
  MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_ID=<database-id>
  # Defaults to 'appwritedatabasemigrationtool'
  MIGRATIONS_COLLECTION_ID=<collection-id>
  # Defaults to 'Migrations'
  MIGRATIONS_COLLECTION_NAME=<collection-name>
  # Defaults to './migrations'
  MIGRATIONS_HOME=<relative-path-to-folder-where-runner-finds-your-migrations>
  ```

- Execute `Create Migrations Collection` once and only once per `project` / `environment`.
  - We prevent duplicate creations, but why take chances. ðŸ˜‡
  - Double check that the `Migrations` collection was created with the following attributes:
    - `$id`: String
    - `applied`: Boolean
    - `name`: String
    - `timestamp`: Integer

- Create your first migration (you should use this script everytime you want to create a new migration).
  - This script is `Node.js` compatible.
  - Your description will be converted to `PascalCase`.
    - Do not use whitespaces
    - Do not use underscores

  ```bash
  # E.g.: npx admt new-migration --outpath ./functions/database/migrations --descriptor initial
  npx admt new-migration --outpath <relative-path> --descriptor <migration-summary>
  ```

- Use the `databaseService` parameter of `up` and `down`, which is an instance of `node-appwrite` Databases class, to define your migration file contents.
- Once you are done, deploy your changes and execute the `Run Migration Sequence` function.

## Appwrite Database Migration Tool Bible

### Rules

- Migrations **must** complete within Appwrite Cloud defined timeout for the function (default is 15s).
  - Longer migrations should be run from local maching, by exporting variables in your `.env.local` for example.
- **Never** change the file name of a migration file.
- **Never** change the class name of a migration class.
- **Always** use codegen tools to create new migration files or other supported operations.

### Recommendations

- Avoid changing the contents of a migration that you have pushed to a production-like environment.
  - Unless you can confidently revert the database state (e.g.: staging) without affecting end-users.
- Provide a meaningful descriptions for your migration using the `--descriptor` flag.
  - Keep them short, like `git commit` messages.
- Follow the expand-and-contract pattern.
  - Read [here](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/types/relational/expand-and-contract-pattern).
- Follow the single-responsibility principle.
  - We do not have direct access to Appwrite's MariaDB instances, thus no real transaction mechanisms are used.
  - It's better to do incremental migrations then one migration that might leave your app in an inconsistent state. Plan your migrations!
- Avoid abstractions in your migration files. They are subject to change in the future. If you use them, ensure that whatever happens, the output of the migration up sequence is always the same. A change of output in a migration M may cause a migration M + x, x > 0, to no longer work as intended.
- Test your migration locally and your staging environment before releasing to production!
- Mistakes happen. If you pushed to production and applying 'down' is not possible, we recommend creating a new migration file to patch the issue.
  - If that is not possible, restore your database to a previous point-in-time (backup).
